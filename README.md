# Reduced Wannier Representation for Topological Bands [(arXiv:2412.17084)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17084)
Code for the paper "Reduced Wannier Representation for Topological Bands" by Trey Cole and David Vanderbilt. 

Results are generated using the following packages
- `pythtb`
- `wanpy`

The `wanpy` package adds functionality for computing maximally localized Wannier functions in `pythtb`, but has not yet been included in a release. The repository for `wanpy` is linked in this directory or can be found [here](https://github.com/treycole/WanPy).
